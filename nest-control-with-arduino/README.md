Project Description:
    Reads the real temperature using Arduino and programs NEST accordingly
    
    problem statement:
        NEST thermostat is placed in one location but if the house is fairly large(like mine), the temperature at sensor location and actual dwelling location might vary quite large. So, adjusting NEST based on the 'real' temperature at the living room or office room becomes important. Hence this project.
